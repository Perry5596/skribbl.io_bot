A skribbl.io assistant that gives you all possible word options for the current amount of characters and spaces.

There are two versions in these files. One is the app.py file that can be run straight from a CLI. The other is the popup.html file which is setup to be a chrome extension popup. Just load the entire folder to a chrome extension and it will work when you open the extension.
